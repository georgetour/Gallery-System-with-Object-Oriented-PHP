# Gallery-System-with-Object-Oriented-PHP

This is a gallery system I made before some months that uses Object Oriented PHP which registered users can upload images. It uses latest techniques like ajax calls, wysiwyg editor, pagination, commenting system and many other cool stuff.

To install just place all the files in local server enviroment like xampp or wampp. I have a dump sql file in mysql dump folder which you can find some demo data for your database. The database info can be found at admin/includes/new_config.php.

## admin
- It contains everything that runs the admin so users will be able to upload their files. All the php files have meaningfull names with comments.

## admin/css
- All our css for admin is here

## admin/font-awesome

## admin/fonts

## admin/images

## admin/includes
